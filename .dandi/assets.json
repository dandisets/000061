"the consolidation of context-dependent emotional memory requires communication between the hippocampusand the basolateral amygdala (bla), but the mechanisms of this process are unknown. we recorded neuronalensembles in the hippocampus and bla while rats learned the location of an aversive air puff on a lineartrack, as well as during sleep before and after training. we found coordinated reactivations between thehippocampus and the bla during non-rem sleep following training. these reactivations peaked duringhippocampal sharp wave-ripples (spw-rs) and involved a subgroup of bla cells positively modulated duringhippocampal spw-rs. notably, reactivation was stronger for the hippocampus-bla correlation patternsrepresenting the run direction that involved the air puff than for the 'safe' direction. these findingssuggest that consolidation of contextual emotional memory occurs during ripple-reactivation ofhippocampus-amygdala circuits.",

"the consolidation of context-dependent emotional memory requires communication between the hippocampusand the basolateral amygdala (bla), but the mechanisms of this process are unknown. we recorded neuronalensembles in the hippocampus and bla while rats learned the location of an aversive air puff on a lineartrack, as well as during sleep before and after training. we found coordinated reactivations between thehippocampus and the bla during non-rem sleep following training. these reactivations peaked duringhippocampal sharp wave-ripples (spw-rs) and involved a subgroup of bla cells positively modulated duringhippocampal spw-rs. notably, reactivation was stronger for the hippocampus-bla correlation patternsrepresenting the run direction that involved the air puff than for the 'safe' direction. these findingssuggest that consolidation of contextual emotional memory occurs during ripple-reactivation ofhippocampus-amygdala circuits.",

"the consolidation of context-dependent emotional memory requires communication between the hippocampusand the basolateral amygdala (bla), but the mechanisms of this process are unknown. we recorded neuronalensembles in the hippocampus and bla while rats learned the location of an aversive air puff on a lineartrack, as well as during sleep before and after training. we found coordinated reactivations between thehippocampus and the bla during non-rem sleep following training. these reactivations peaked duringhippocampal sharp wave-ripples (spw-rs) and involved a subgroup of bla cells positively modulated duringhippocampal spw-rs. notably, reactivation was stronger for the hippocampus-bla correlation patternsrepresenting the run direction that involved the air puff than for the 'safe' direction. these findingssuggest that consolidation of contextual emotional memory occurs during ripple-reactivation ofhippocampus-amygdala circuits.",

"the consolidation of context-dependent emotional memory requires communication between the hippocampusand the basolateral amygdala (bla), but the mechanisms of this process are unknown. we recorded neuronalensembles in the hippocampus and bla while rats learned the location of an aversive air puff on a lineartrack, as well as during sleep before and after training. we found coordinated reactivations between thehippocampus and the bla during non-rem sleep following training. these reactivations peaked duringhippocampal sharp wave-ripples (spw-rs) and involved a subgroup of bla cells positively modulated duringhippocampal spw-rs. notably, reactivation was stronger for the hippocampus-bla correlation patternsrepresenting the run direction that involved the air puff than for the 'safe' direction. these findingssuggest that consolidation of contextual emotional memory occurs during ripple-reactivation ofhippocampus-amygdala circuits.",

"session_description":
"the consolidation of context-dependent emotional memory requires communication between the hippocampusand the basolateral amygdala (bla), but the mechanisms of this process are unknown. we recorded neuronalensembles in the hippocampus and bla while rats learned the location of an aversive air puff on a lineartrack, as well as during sleep before and after training. we found coordinated reactivations between thehippocampus and the bla during non-rem sleep following training. these reactivations peaked duringhippocampal sharp wave-ripples (spw-rs) and involved a subgroup of bla cells positively modulated duringhippocampal spw-rs. notably, reactivation was stronger for the hippocampus-bla correlation patternsrepresenting the run direction that involved the air puff than for the 'safe' direction. these findingssuggest that consolidation of contextual emotional memory occurs during ripple-reactivation ofhippocampus-amygdala circuits.",
