description: The consolidation of context-dependent emotional memory requires communication
  between the hippocampus and the basolateral amygdala (BLA), but the mechanisms of
  this process are unknown. We recorded neuronal ensembles in the hippocampus and
  BLA while rats learned the location of an aversive air puff on a linear track, as
  well as during sleep before and after training. We found coordinated reactivations
  between the hippocampus and the BLA during non-REM sleep following training. These
  reactivations peaked during hippocampal sharp wave–ripples (SPW-Rs) and involved
  a subgroup of BLA cells positively modulated during hippocampal SPW-Rs. Notably,
  reactivation was stronger for the hippocampus–BLA correlation patterns representing
  the run direction that involved the air puff than for the 'safe' direction. These
  findings suggest that consolidation of contextual emotional memory occurs during
  ripple-reactivation of hippocampus–amygdala circuits.
